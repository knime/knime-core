		<intro>
			Extracts the selected fields from a duration or period column
			and appends the
			values as integer or long columns. Valid fields are
			hour, minute, second and
			nanosecond for a duration and year, month and
			day for a period. There are two modes: either breaks down the
			duration into its individuals by selecting several fields, or get the
			whole duration/period in a single number by selecting only a single field.

			<option name="Single Value">
				A field can be selected to which the actual
				period or duration gets
				converted. The extracted field is truncated,
				e.g. from a duration holding 2 hours, 30 minutes and
				15 seconds the
				node extracts either 2 hours, 150 minutes or 9015 seconds. The
				extracted field will be appended as a new column.
			</option>
			<option name="Several Values">
				Several fields can be selected to extract. The
				duration or period gets broken down in its individual parts, e.g.
				from a duration holding 2 hours, 30 minutes and
				15 seconds the node
				extracts (depending on the selection) 2 hours, 30
				minutes and 15
				seconds.
				The
				extracted fields will be appended as new columns.
