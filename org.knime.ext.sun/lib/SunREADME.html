<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<blockquote>Thank you for downloading this release of the Java<sup><font
  size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK<sup><font
  size="-2">TM</font></sup>). The JDK is a development environment for building
applications, applets, and components using the Java programming language.
<p>The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written
in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform. These tools
are designed to be used from the command line. Except for the appletviewer,
these tools do not provide a graphical user interface.
<p>

<h2><a name="install">System Requirements &amp; Installation</a></h2>
<blockquote>System requirements, installation instructions and
troubleshooting tips are located on the Java Software web site at:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/install.html"> JDK<sup><font
    size="-2">TM</font></sup> 5.0 Installation Instructions</a>
</ul>

</blockquote>


<h2><a name="docs">JDK Documentation</a></h2>
<blockquote>The on-line <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/index.html">Java 2 Platform
Standard Edition Documentation</a> contains API specifications, feature
descriptions, developer guides, reference pages for JDK tools and utilities,
demos, and links to related information. This documentation is also available in
a download bundle which you can install on your machine. To obtain the
documentation bundle, see the <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html">download page</a>. For API
documentation, refer to the <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html">The Java 2
Platform Standard Edition API Specification</a> This provides brief descriptions of
the API with an emphasis on specifications, not on code examples.</blockquote>


<h2><a name=relnotes>Release Notes</a></h2>
<blockquote>See the <a
  href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/relnotes.html>Release Notes</a> on the
Java Software web site for additional information pertaining to this release.
The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should check it
occasionally for the latest information.</blockquote>


<h2><a name=compatibility>Compatibility</a></h2>
<blockquote>See <a
  href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html> Compatibility with
Previous Releases</a> on the Java Software web site for the list of known
compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to support programs written for
previous versions of the Java platform. Although some incompatible changes were
necessary, most software should migrate to the current version with no
reprogramming. Any failure to do so is considered a bug, except for a small
number of cases where compatibility was deliberately broken, as described on our
compatibility web page. Some compatibility-breaking changes were required to
close potential security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.</blockquote>


<h2><a name=bugs>Bug Reports and Feedback</a></h2>

<h2><a name=contents>Contents of the JDK</a></h2>
<blockquote>This section contains a general summary of the files
and directories in the JDK. For details on the files and directories, see <a
  href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html>JDK File
Structure</a> portion of the J2SE documentation.

<dl>
  <dt><b>Development Tools</b>
  <dd>(In the <code>bin</code> subdirectory.) Tools and utilities that will
  help you develop, execute, debug, and document programs written in the Java
  programming language. For further information, see the <a
    href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html>tool
  documentation</a>.

  <p>
  <dt><b>Runtime Environment</b>
  <dd>(In the <code>jre</code> subdirectory.) An implementation of the J2SE
  runtime environment for use by the JDK. The runtime environment includes a
  Java virtual machine, class libraries, and other files that support the
  execution of programs written in the Java programming language.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Additional Libraries</b>
  <dd>(In the <code>lib</code> subdirectory.) Additional class libraries
  and support files required by the development tools.
  <p>
  <dt><b>Demo Applets and Applications</b>
  <dd>(In the <code>demo</code> subdirectory.) Examples, with source code,
  of programming for the Java platform. These include examples that use Swing
  and other Java Foundation Classes, and the Java Platform Debugger
  Architecture.
  <p>
  <dt><b>C header Files</b>
  <dd>(In the <code>include</code> subdirectory.) Header files that support
  native-code programming using the <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/index.html">Java
  Native Interface</a>, the <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmti/index.html">JVM<sup><font
    size=-2>TM</font></sup> Tool Interface</a>, and other functionality of the Java 2
  Platform.

  <p>
  <dt><b>Source Code</b>
  <dd>(In <code>src.zip</code>.) Java programming language source files for
  all classes that make up the Java&nbsp;2 core API (that is, sources files for
  the java.*, javax.* and some org.* packages, but not for com.sun.* packages).
  This source code is provided for informational purposes only, to help
  developers learn and use the Java programming language. These files do not
  include platform-specific implementation code and cannot be used to rebuild
  the class libraries. To extract these file, use any common zip utility. Or,
  you may use the Jar utility in the JDK's <tt>bin</tt> directory: <pre>
    jar xvf src.zip
</pre>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name=jre>The J2SE Runtime Environment</a></h2>
<blockquote>The J2SE Runtime Environment is available as a
separately downloadable product. See the <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html">download web site</a>.
<p>The J2SE Runtime Environment allows you to run applications written in
the Java programming language. Like the JDK, it contains the Java virtual
machine, classes comprising the Java 2 Platform API, and supporting files.
Unlike the JDK, it does not contain development tools such as compilers and
debuggers.
<p>You can freely redistribute the J2SE Runtime Environment with your
application, according to the terms of the Runtime Environment's license. Once
you have developed your application using the JDK, you can ship it with the
Runtime Environment so your end-users will have a Java platform on which to run
your software.
</blockquote>

<h3>Required vs. Optional Files</h3>

The files that make up the J2SE Development Kit are divided into two categories:
required and optional. Optional files may be excluded from redistributions of
the JDK at the vendor's discretion.
<p>The following section contains a list of the files and directories that
may optionally be omitted from redistributions of the JDK. All files not in
these lists of optional files must be included in redistributions of the JDK.
<h3>Optional Files and Directories</h3>

The following files may be optionally excluded from redistributions. These files
are located in the jdk1.5.0_&lt;version&gt; directory, where &lt;version&gt; is
the update version number. Solaris and Linux filenames and separators are shown.
Windows executables have the ".exe" suffix. Corresponding files with <code>_g</code>
in name can also be excluded.

<h3>Redistributable JDK Files</h3>

The limited set of files from the JDK listed below may be included in vendor
redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment. They cannot be redistributed
separately, and must accompany a JRE distribution. All paths are relative to the
top-level directory of the JDK.

<dl>
  <dt><tt>jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf</tt>
  <dd>Color profile. This file is required only if one wishes to convert
  between the PYCC color space and another color space.
  <dt>All <tt>.ttf</tt> font files in the <tt>jre/lib/fonts</tt> directory.


  
  <dd>Note that the LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained in the
  J2SE Runtime Environment, so there is no need to bring that file over from the
  JDK.
  <dt><tt>jre/lib/audio/soundbank.gm</tt>
  <dd>This MIDI soundbank is present in the JDK, but it has been removed
  from the J2SE Runtime Environment in order to reduce the size of the Runtime
  Environment's download bundle. However, a soundbank file is necessary for MIDI
  playback, and therefore the JDK's <tt>soundbank.gm</tt> file may be included
  in redistributions of the Runtime Environment at the vendor's discretion.
  Several versions of enhanced MIDI soundbanks are available from the Java Sound
  web site: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/">http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/</a>.
  These alternative soundbanks may be included in redistributions of the J2SE
  Runtime Environment.
  <dt>The javac bytecode compiler, consisting of the following files:
  <dd><tt>bin/javac</tt> [Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux]<br>
  <tt>bin/sparcv9/javac</tt> [Solaris Operating System (SPARC(R) Platform
  Edition)]<br>
  <tt>bin/amd64/javac</tt> [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]<br>
  <tt>bin/javac.exe</tt> [Microsoft Windows]<br>
  <tt>lib/tools.jar</tt> [All platforms]
  <dt>The Annotation Processing Tool, consisting of the following files:<br>
  <dd><tt>bin/apt</tt> [Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux]<br>
  <tt>bin/sparcv9/apt</tt> [Solaris Operating System (SPARC(R) Platform
  Edition)]<br>
  <tt>bin/amd64/apt</tt> [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]<br>
  <tt>bin/apt.exe</tt> [Microsoft Windows]
  <dt><tt>jre\bin\server\</tt>
  <dd>On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both the Java
  HotSpot Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM. However, the J2SE Runtime
  Environment for Microsoft Windows platforms includes only the Java HotSpot
  Client VM. Those wishing to use the Java HotSpot Server VM with the J2SE
  Runtime Environment may copy the JDK's <tt>jre\bin\server</tt> folder to a <tt>bin\server</tt>
  directory in the J2SE Runtime Environment. Software vendors may redistribute
  the Java HotSpot Server VM with their redistributions of the J2SE Runtime
  Environment.
</dl>

<h3>Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension</h3>
Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java Cryptography
Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the J2SE Development Kit and the J2SE
Runtime Environment allow strong but limited cryptography to be used. These
files are located at
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/local_policy.jar
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar
</pre></blockquote>
where <tt>&lt;java-home&gt;</tt> is the <tt>jre</tt> directory of the JDK or the
top-level directory of the J2SE Runtime Environment.
<p>An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions
on cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for those living in
eligible countries. Those living in eligible countries may download the
unlimited strength version and replace the strong cryptography jar files with
the unlimited strength files.
<h3>jconsole</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>jconsole.jar</tt>
  <dd>jconsole may be redistributed outside the JDK but only with Sun's
  JRE.
</dl>

<h3>Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism</h3>

An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards process other
than the Java Community Process<sup><font size="-1">SM</font></sup> (JCP<sup><font
  size="-1">SM</font></sup>). Because endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP,
it is anticipated that such standards will be revised between releases of the
Java 2 Platform. In order to take advantage of new revisions to endorsed
standards, developers and software vendors may use the Endorsed Standards
Override Mechanism to provide newer versions of an endorsed standard than those
included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems.
<p>For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism,
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to override, see
<blockquote><a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced only by
classes implementing a more recent version of the API as defined by the
appropriate standards body.
<p>In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above URL,
which are part of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE<sup><font
  size="-2">TM</font></sup>) specification, redistributors of Sun's J2SE Reference
Implementation are allowed to override classes whose sole purpose is to
implement the functionality provided by public APIs defined in these Endorsed
Standards packages. Redistributors may also override classes in the <tt>org.w3c.dom.*</tt>
packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement these APIs.
<h3>The cacerts Certificates File<BR>
</h3>
Root CA certificates may be added to or removed from the J2SE certificate file
located at <code>&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/cacerts</code>. For more
information, see <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html#cacerts">
The cacerts Certificates File</a> section in the keytool documentation.</blockquote>
