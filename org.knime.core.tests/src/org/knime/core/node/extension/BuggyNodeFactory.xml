        <intro>
			Compares two columns by their attribute value pairs and shows the 
		    confusion matrix, i.e. how many rows of which attribute and their 
		    classification match. 
		    Additionally, it is possible to hilight cells of this matrix to
		    determine the underlying rows.
		    The dialog allows you to select two columns for comparison;
			the values from the first selected column are represented in the 
			confusion matrix's rows and the values from the second column by the
			confusion matrix's columns. The output of the node is the confusion 
			matrix with the number of matches in each cell.
			Additionally, the second out-port reports a number of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">
			accuracy statistics</a> such as True-Positives, False-Positives, 
			True-Negatives, False-Negatives, Recall, Precision, Sensitivity, 
			Specificity, F-measure, as well as the overall accuracy and 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa">Cohen's kappa</a>.

        <option name="First column">The first column represents the real classes of the data.</option>
        <option name="Second column">The second column represents the predicted classes of the data.</option>
        <option name="Sorting strategy">Whether to sort the labels according to their appearance, or use the lexical/numeric ordering.</option>
        <option name="Reverse order">Reverse the order of the elements.</option>
        <option name="Use name prefix">The scores (i.e. accuracy, error rate, number of correct and wrong classification) are exported
        as flow variables with a hard coded name. This option allows you to define a prefix for these variable identifiers so that name
        conflicts are resolved.</option>
        <option name="Missing Values">Choose how to treat missing values in either the reference or prediction column. 
        Default is to ignore them (treat them as if the row did not exist). Alternatively, you can expect the table to 
        not contain missing values in these two columns. If they do, the node will fail during execution.</option>

			Displays the confusion matrix in a table view. It is possible

			to the corresponding rows. Therefore, it is possible for example to
