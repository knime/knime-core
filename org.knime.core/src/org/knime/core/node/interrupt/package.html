This package contains the necessary classes for an interruptible framework.
The <code>InterruptibleNodeModel</code> consists of three abstract methods:
<ul>
	<li><code>init(DataTable[] input)</code></li>
	<li><code>executeOneIteration()</code></li>
	<li><code>DataTable[] getOutput()</code></li>
</ul>
When an InterruptibleNodeModel is executed, first the <code>init m(DataTable[])</code> 
method is called. The model starts with <code>paused = true</code>. 
When this is set to <code>paused = false</code> the
<code>executeOneIteration</code> method is called until the model is set to the 
paused state again. In this way the model could be run and paused arbitrary often.
When the model is set to <code>finish()</code> the 
<code>getOutput()</code>method is called and the result is provided at the out-port 
and the model is executed and must be reset for a new run.
<br />

Existing models can be easily be adapted to an interruptible model, since most 
of  all models contain a <code>for-</code> or <code>while-</code>loop. 
Then the content of this loop has to be put into <code>executeOneIteration</code>
method.
<br />

A default implementation for the <code>InterruptibleNodeView</code> is also provided, with 
some default control elements always on top. These control elements are contained 
in the <code>InterruptControlPanel</code>. They are a play, break and finish and
a next step button and a slider to adjust the delay how often the 
<code>InterruptibleNodeView</code> is refreshed.
