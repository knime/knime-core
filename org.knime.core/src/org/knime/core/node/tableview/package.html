<BODY>
<P> Node implementation of a table view. This node is used in the KNIME workflow
	to display a <CODE>DataTable,</CODE> thus it has one inport and no outports.
</P>

<P> In order to provide a reasonably fast view the key class of this package,
	i.e. <CODE>TableContentModel</CODE>, uses a caching strategy that reads rows
	from the <CODE>DataTable</CODE> on request and (ring-)buffers only the last 
	accessed sequence of rows. For further details refer to the description of
	<a href="TableContentModel.html"><CODE>TableContentModel</CODE></a>.
</P>

	<H3 id="relation">Class relationship</H3>
	The following figure summarizes the role of the different classes in this 
	package. For simplicity we ignore the general node classes 
	<CODE>TableNodeFactory</CODE>, <CODE>TableNodeModel</CODE> and 
	<CODE>TableNodeView</CODE> as they provide the usual node functionality.

	<CODE>TableContentModel</CODE> is certainly the class containing most of
	the functionality. It is the <CODE>TableModel</CODE> for the 
	<CODE>TableContentView</CODE> and has a reference to the 
	<CODE>DataTable</CODE> to be displayed. It contains the row cache and also
	serves as the <CODE>HiLiteListener</CODE> (as it knows which rows it has 
	to care about). <br>
	<CODE>TableHeaderModel</CODE> is also a class implementing 
	<CODE>javax.swing.TableModel</CODE>. It keeps a reference to its 
	<CODE>TableContentModel</CODE> and encapsulates the keys for each row in 
	the <CODE>DataTable</CODE>. Hence, it always has exactly one column. We had
	to detach this model from the content model since the main view, i.e.
	<CODE>TableView</CODE> displays the row head in separate panel.
