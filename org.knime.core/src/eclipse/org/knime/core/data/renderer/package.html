<body>
	Interfaces and default implementations for renderer of <code>DataValue</code>
	objects.
	<p>
		This package describes the general structure for renderer and renderer
		families of <code>DataValue</code>. Generally, each 
		{@link org.knime.core.data.DataValue <code>DataValue</code>}
		implementation can define its own set of renderer. These renderer
		are accumulated in a <code>DataValueRendererFamily</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is what you should do if you implement your own 
		<code>DataValue</code> and make one or more renderer available for it:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create your own renderer implementing the 
			<code>DataValueRenderer</code> interface. (You might consider to 
			derive from <code>DefaultDataValueRenderer</code>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Implement a <code>DataValueRendererFamily</code> that either
			uses singletons of the renderers above or creates them on 
			request. As before: it is probably useful to extend the default
			implementation, i.e. <code>DefaultDataValueRendererFamily</code>.
			Such a family is responsible to handle multiple different
			renderers.
		</li>
		<li>Make a {@link org.knime.core.data.DataValue.UtilityFactory 
               UtilityFactory} in your <code>DataValue</code> implementation 
               available as described in the 
               <a href="../doc-files/newtypes.html#newtypes">manual</a>
			methode <code>getNativeRenderer()</code> and return your newly
			created renderer family therein.
		</li>
	</ul>
