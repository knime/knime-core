/**
 * Allows extensions to register resources with a workflow, which get disposed when the workflow itself is disposed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typical use cases are workflow-wide caches or resources that are shared between multiple nodes in a workflow. The
 * nodes itself should unregister the resource when they are disposed to prevent memory leaks but this global resource
 * cleanup is a safety net in case a node forgets to do so.
 *
 * <p>
 * Registering and retrieving a resource needs to be done while a thread is annotated with a {@link NodeContext},
 * which is guaranteed by the framework for node execution and other typical workflow operations (e.g. in dialog code).
