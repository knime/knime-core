    <name>Independent groups t-test</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        This test is designed to compare the means of observations in the same column between two groups.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Computes statistics for the independent groups t-test, 
        also know as the two sample t-test. It is designed 
        to compare the means of observations in the same column between 
        two groups. The node allows the testing of equality of variances 
        (Levene's test) and the t-value for both equal- and unequal-variance. 
        It also provides the relevant descriptive statistics.</intro>
        
        <option name="Grouping column">Column holding the grouping information
        data.

        <option name="Grouping one">All rows of the input table which have this
        this value in the grouping column are assigned to group one.
        </option>
        <option name="Grouping two">All rows of the input table which have this
        this value in the grouping column are assigned to group two.
        </option>
        <option name="Confidence Interval (in %)">
	    The limits for the confidence interval are computed using this number. The
	    default is 95 which means that you can be 95% confident that the true value 
	    of the parameter is in the confidence interval.

        <option name="Test columns">
        A independent groups t-test is performed separately for each of these columns.
