    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        <p>
				Manipulates strings like search and replace,
				capitalize or remove leading and trailing white spaces.
	        </p>
	        <b>Examples:</b>
	        <p>
	            To remove leading and trailing blanks from a column with name
	            <i>c0</i> you would use the expression:<br/>
	            <i>strip($c0$)</i>
	        </p>
            <p>
                If you have your customer names in column <i>names</i>  
                with titles Mr and Mister and you
                want to normalize the data so that only Mr is used you could
                use the expression: <br/>
                <i>replace($names$, "Mister", "Mr")</i><br/>
                or you could combine it to<br/>
                <i>replace(replace($names$, "Mister", "Mr"), "Miss", "Ms")</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Or if you want to have the number of characters of the strings
                in a column with name <i>text</i>: <br/>
                <i>length($text$)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               Note that strings which are part of the expression and are not from the 
               input data (or the result of another wrapped function call) need
               to be enclosed in double quotes ('"'). Additionally, if the string contains a 
               quote character, it must be escaped using a backslash character ('\"'). 
               Finally, other special characters such as single quotes and backslashes need 
               to be escaped using a backslash. For instance, a single backslash in a string 
               is written as two consecutive backslash characters; the first one acts as 
               the escape character for the second.

		<option name="Column List">
		  The list contains the column that are available in the input table.
		  Double click any of the column names to insert the respective field
		  in the expression editor. It will replace your current selection or
		  simply insert at the current caret position.
		</option>
		<option name="Flow Variable List">
		  The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
		  the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
		  respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
		  selection, if any).
		</option>
		<option name="Function">
		  Select a single function to display its description. A double click
		  will insert the function in the expression editor. 
		  It will replace your current selection or
          simply insert at the current caret position.
		  Select a category to narrow down the list of displayed functions.
		</option>
		<option name="Expression">
		  The place for your business logic. You can hit <i>ctrl+space</i> to
		  get an auto completion box. 
		</option>
		<option name="Replace/Append">
          Specify here if you want the result to be put into a separate or 
          existing column.
        </option>
		<option name="Insert Missing As Null">
		  If selected, missing values in the input table will be represented
		  by <tt>null</tt> in the expression. If unselected,
		  a missing value in the input will produce
		  a missing output cell without evaluating the expression. 
		</option>
		<option name="Syntax check on close">
		  If unchecked the dialog can be closed even when the expression has
		  syntax errors.
