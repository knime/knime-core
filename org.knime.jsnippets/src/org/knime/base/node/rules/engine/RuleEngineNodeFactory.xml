	<name>Rule Engine</name>
	<shortDescription>
		 Applies user-defined business rules to the input table
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>This node takes a list of user-defined rules and tries to match them to each
        row in the input table. If a rule matches, its outcome value is added into a new column.
        The first matching rule will provide the outcome.
        <p>
        The comments start with <tt>//</tt>, and anything after that is not interpreted as a rule in that line.
	 	Rules consist of a condition part (antecedent), which must evaluate to <i>true</i>
        or <i>false</i>, and an outcome (consequent, after the => symbol) which is put into the new column if the rule matches.
        Each rule is represented by a line.
        The most simple rule is a comparison between a column and another column, a constant number or string.
        </p>
        <p>The outcome of a rule can either be a constant string, a constant number, or a reference to another column or flow variable value.
        The type of the outcome column is the common super type of all possible outcomes including the default label.
        </p>
        <p>
        Columns are given by their name surrounded by $, numbers are given in the usual decimal representation. Note that
        strings must not contain (double-)quotes. The flow variables are represented by <b>$${</b>TypeCharacterAndFlowVarName<b>}$$</b>.
        The TypeCharacter should be 'D' for double (real) values, 'I' for integer values and 'S' for strings.
        </p>
        <p>The logical expressions can (and should) be grouped with parentheses because there is no pre-defined
        operator precedence for the logical connectives (NOT, AND, OR, XOR) (comparison operators always take precedence
        over logical connectives).
        All operators are case-sensitive.
        The NOT operator negates all following expressions, not just the direct following expression.
        </p>
        <p>The <tt>ROWID</tt> represents the row key string, the <tt>ROWINDEX</tt> is a the index of the row (first row has <tt>0</tt> value),
        while <tt>ROWCOUNT</tt> stands for the number of rows in the table.
        </p>
        <p>Some example rules (each should be in one line):</p>
        <pre>
// This is a comment
$Col0$ > 0 => "Positive"
</pre>
        When the values in Col0 are greater than 0, we assign Positive to the result column value (if no previous rule matched).
<pre>
$Col0$ = "Active" AND $Col1$ &lt;= 5 => "Outlier"
</pre>
        You can combine conditions.
<pre>
$Col0$ LIKE "Market Street*" AND 
    ($Col1$ IN ("married", "divorced") 
        OR $Col2$ > 40) => "Strange"
$Col0$ CONTAINS $${SFlowVar0}$$ OR $$ROWINDEX$$ &lt; $${IFlowVar1}$$ =>
    $Col0$
</pre>
        With parentheses you can combine multiple conditions. The result in this case comes from one of the columns.
<pre>
$Col0$ > 5 => $${SCol1}$$
</pre>
        The result can also come from a flow variable.
<pre>
"Hello world" CONTAINS "ll+o" => "Always true"
        </pre>
        The regular expression ll+o (at least two ls followed by o) will always be present in Hello, so this rule will match.
        <p>
        You can use either Ctrl+Space to insert predefined parts, or select them from the upper controls.
