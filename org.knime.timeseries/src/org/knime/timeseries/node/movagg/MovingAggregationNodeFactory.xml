    <name>Moving Aggregation</name>
    <shortDescription>Adds a column with moving average values.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>
            This node calculates aggregation values for a moving window.
            The aggregation values are displayed in new columns appended 
            at the end of the table.
            </p>
            <p>
           The columns to aggregate can be either defined by selecting the columns directly, 
           by name based on a search pattern or based on the data type. Input columns are handled in
           this order and only considered once e.g. columns that are added directly on the
           "Manual Aggregation" tab are ignored even if their name matches a search pattern on the 
           "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab or their type matches a defined type on the
           "Type Based Aggregation" tab. The same holds for columns that are added based on a search pattern. 
           They are ignored even if they match a criterion that has been defined in the "Type Based Aggregation" tab.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Manual Aggregation" tab allows you to change the aggregation method of more than one 
            column. In order to do so select the columns to change, open the context menu with a right mouse click
            and select the aggregation method to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab you can assign aggregation methods to columns based on a  
            search pattern. The pattern can be either a string with wildcards or a
            <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
            Columns where the name matches the pattern but where the data type is not compatible with the
            selected aggregation method are ignored. Only columns that have not been selected as aggregation column on 
            the "Manual Aggregation" tab are considered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Type Based Aggregation" tab allows to select an aggregation method for all columns of a certain 
            data type e.g. to compute the mean for all numerical columns (DoubleCell). Only columns that have not 
            been handled by the other tabs e.g. column based and pattern based are considered.
            The data type list to choose from contains basic types e.g String, Double, etc. and all data types 
            the current input table contains.
           </p>
            <p>
            A detailed description of the available aggregation methods can be
            found on the 'Description' tab in the node dialog.

                If selected the aggregation values of incomplete windows, 
                are computed based on the data rows available so far.

            <option name="Cumulative computation">
                Select this option to compute cumulative values e.g. cumulative sum over the whole table.
                Each result row is computed by aggregating the values from the first row to the current row.

              If selected the columns used to aggregate are filtered from the output table.

                columns list. Change the aggregation method in the Aggregation 
                column of the table. You can add the same column multiple
                times. In order to change the aggregation method of more than one 
                column select all columns to change, open the context menu with a

                aggregation table.
                Some aggregation methods do not support the changing of the missing

                The parameter column shows an "Edit" button for all

                <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
                Supported wildcards are * (matches any number of characters) and ? (matches one character) e.g. KNI*
                would match all strings that start with KNI such as KNIME whereas KNI? would match only strings that start
                with KNI followed by a fourth character. 
                Double click the "Search pattern" cell to edit the pattern.

                    Keeps the original column names.
                    Note that you can use all aggregation columns only once with

                between columns that considered missing values in the aggregation
                process and columns that do not.
