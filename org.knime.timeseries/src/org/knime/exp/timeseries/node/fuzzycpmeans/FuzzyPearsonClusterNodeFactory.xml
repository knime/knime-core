	<option name="Number of clusters">
	Number of clusters to use for the algorithm.
    </option>
    <option name="Maximum number of iterations">
    This is the maximum number of iterations to be performed.
    </option>
    <option name="Fuzzifier">
    Indicates how much the clusters are allowed to overlap.
    </option>
    <option name="Induce noise cluster">
    Whether to induce a noise cluster or not.
    </option>
     <option name="Set delta">
    Delta is the fixed distance from every datapoint to the noise cluster.
    </option>
    <option name="Set delta automatically, specify lambda">
    Delta is updated in each iteration, based on the average interpoint 
    distances. However, a lambda parameter has to be set, according to the
    shape of the clusters.
    </option>
    <option name="Perform the clustering in memory">
    If this option is selected, the clustering is performed in the memory,
    which speeds up the process.
    </option>
    <option name="Compute cluster quality measures">
    Whether to calculate quality measures for the clustering. This can be
    time and memory consuming with large datasets.
    </option>
