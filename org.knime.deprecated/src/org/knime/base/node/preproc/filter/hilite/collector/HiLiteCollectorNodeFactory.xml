        <intro>
        Node allows to apply annotations to sets of hilit rows within the view
        of the non-executed node.
        (1) Within the view, an annotation string can be entered which is then 
        appended to all hilit rows. (2) During execution of this node, all
        annotations are appended as extra columns, 'Anno #X', to the end of 
        the input table. (3) If the node is reset, all annotations are 
        internally removed; also all annotations added while the node is 
        executed, don't affect the output table. 
        </intro>
        <option name="Append Annotation">
            Enter a new, non-empty annotation string which is then applied to 
            the current set of hilit rows. All sub-sequent annotations to the 
            same row, will be appended to the current string and separated by 
            comma. If selected, a new column with the current annotation is
            appended to the table.
