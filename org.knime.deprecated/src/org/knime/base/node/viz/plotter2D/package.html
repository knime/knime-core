  <title>Abstract Plotter Functionality</title>
</head>
<body>
Contains the implementation of the abstract plotter functionality of 2D plots<br>
<br>
The package contains an abstract Plotter2D and abstract DrawingPane.<br>
Both provide the basic functionality of every 2D Plot.
Beside others this is the selection tangle handling and cursor painting (cross
hair)
<br>
There is also a default Header implementation which is not abstract as assumed
to be reusable when needed. The Plotter2DScrollPane and the 
Plotter2DScrollPaneLayout are subclasses of the default ScrollPane and 
ScrollPaneLayout to rearange the headers.
