  <title>Scatterplot Node</title>
</head>
<body>
Contains the implementation of a node for the workflow that plots data
in a scatter plot.<br>
<br>
The node has one input port and no output. The user must select two
numerical columns from the input data table, one for the X-axis and one
for the Y-axis of the plot. The view then plots one dot for each row in
the table with the coordinates taken from the x- and y-column, with a
selectable dot size into a zoomable area.<br>
<br>
The <code>ScatterPlotNodeModel</code> extracts during execute the
selected data from
the input table and stores the selected number of X/Y coord in a
<code>RowInfoContainer</code>. <br>
The <code>ScatterPlotNodeView</code> contains two components: The <code>ScatterProps</code>
which
contains the components to adjust dot size and zoom factor, and the
<code>ScatterPlotter</code> which is the actual plotter.<br>
The <code>ScatterPlotNodeDialog</code> sets the X- and Y-column
selection and the
number of rows to display.<br>
