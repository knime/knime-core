    <name>Testflow Configuration</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Configures a workflow test.
	</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node holds settings for the workflow test. It replaces the
            config files that have been used previously.
            <br />
            The execution of the node does nothing, only the settings entered
            in the dialog will be read later-on by the
            testing framework. When the workflow is execute as a test workflow, this node is always reset prior to
            execution. By using flow variable connections from this node you can ensure that certain nodes are always
            reset, even if they are (accidently) saved in executed state.

        <tab name="Workflow settings">
            <option name="Owner's mail address">
                Enter the e-mail address of the workflow owner here. A mail will be sent
                to this address
                if the workflow test fails. You can enter multiple addresses
                by separating them with commas.
            </option>
            <option name="Execution timeout">
                Set a timeout after which execution of the workflow is canceled and an error
                is reported.
            </option>
            <option name="Maximum number of hilited rows">
                Sets the maximum number of rows that are hilited per data table. This limit is only for preventing
                excessive memory usage in case of very large tables because the hilited row keys are all kept in memory.
            </option>
            <option name="Log Errors, Warnings, Infos">
                These lists contains error, warning, or info messages that must be present
                in the log file after the workflows has been fully executed. Usually these
                are messages written by a NodeLogger.<br />
                You can also use regular expression for log messages in case there are slight variations.
                By default the message is treated as a plain string. By enclosing parts of the string by <tt>_!_</tt>
                you can enter regular expressions in between, e.g. <i>File _!_.+_!_ not found</i>.
            </option>
        </tab>
        <tab name="Node settings">
            <option name="Node is expected to fail">
                If the node selected in the list above is expected to fail for a successful test,
                check this option.
            </option>
            <option name="Required error message">
                Enter the error message on the node selected above that must be
                present after the workflow has been fully executed. If it is not
                present the test fails.<br />
                This field is pre-filled with the current error message of the
                selected node (if there is any), indicated by the gray text color.
                If you want to really use this message click in the text field,
                and possibly edit it. Once the text color is black, the message
                is used.<br />
                You can also use regular expression for required error messages in case there are slight variations.
                By default the message is treated as a plain string. By enclosing parts of the string by <tt>_!_</tt>
                you can enter regular expressions in between, e.g. <i>File _!_.+_!_ not found</i>.
            </option>
            <option name="Required warning message">
                Enter the error message on the node selected above that must be
                present after the workflow has been fully executed. If it is not
                present the test fails.<br />
                This field is pre-filled with the current error message of the
                selected node (if there is any), indicated by the gray text color.
                If you want to really use this message click in the text field,
                and possibly edit it. Once the text color is black, the message
                is used.<br />
                Also warning messages can contain regular expressions, see above.
            </option>
			<option name="Test in streaming mode">
				If checked, the workflow will also be tested in streaming mode, i.e. a
				Test Streaming Executor will be selected for each node and executed.
				Please note that the streaming mode must additionally be allowed in
				the global Testrun Configuration! Otherwise the streaming test will be
				skipped.
			</option>
			<option name="Require workflow version">
				If set, the node will fail on execution if the workflow file was not in
				the specified version.
				This is useful for ensuring that a workflow stays in a specific previous
				version to ensure backwards compatibility with node settings written with
				that version.
				This makes sure that the node settings were not overwritten by a newer
				KNIME version, which would defeat the purpose of the workflow test.
                <p>Note that version numbers from the drop-down don't necessarily correspond
                to KNIME releases; these version strings are used internally in the framework
                and are written to the workflow.knime.</p>
