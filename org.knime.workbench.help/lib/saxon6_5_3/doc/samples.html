<p><i>Note: the example commands here are for the Windows platform, using the SUN
Java Virtual Machine. To use Microsoft's Java VM, substitute "jview" for "java". UNIX users will
have little difficulty in adapting the commands; the only real change is to use "/" instead
of "\" in path names (this affects the command line only: the Java code itself
 should work on any platform). Running Java applications
on a Macintosh is a little more complicated, because of the absence of a
conventional command line.</i></p> 


<hr>

<h2><a name="dtdgen">DTDGenerator</a></h2>

<p>This is a utility which, given an XML document as input, produces a document type
definition (DTD) as output.</p>

<p>See <a HREF="dtdgen.html">here</a> for details.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="trax">TRAX examples</a></h2>

<p>Saxon supports the TrAX Java API (packag javax.xml.transform) for invoking the stylesheet processor.
This API is useful when you want to write your own applications that invoke Saxon.</p>

<p>A sample program that illustrates many features of the TrAX interface is included in
the distribution as <b>TraxExamples.java</b>. Source XML and XSL files for use with this
program are included in the <b>trax</b> directory. To run the program, use the command:

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
cd $saxonhome/samples/trax
java TraxExamples <br>
</font></strong></code></p>


<p>One of the examples shows how to use TrAX to process input from a third-party (non-Saxon)
DOM document, and how to
send output to a third-party DOM document. This example tests to see if either Crimson or
Xerces is present on the classpath; if not, it should fail cleanly. You will need to change the
source code and recompile if you want to
use it with a different DOM implementation.</p>


<hr>

<h2><a name="servlet">SaxonServlet</a></h2>

<p>This is a general-purpose servlet that takes the name of a source document and stylesheet
as URL parameters, and processes the stylesheet to create a result document which is sent back
to the browser for display. The result document may have any media type, though HTML and XML are
the most likely.</p>

<p>The servlet maintains a cache of prepared stylesheets; if the same stylesheet is used repeatedly,
it is only parsed and validated once, which will often greatly improve performance. Prepared style
sheets are thread-safe so they can be used to serve documents to several users concurrently.</p>

<p>The URLs for the source document and the stylesheet document are supplied in the URL,
which will typically take the form:</p>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
http://server.com/servlets/SaxonServlet?source=doc.xml&style=sheet.xsl
</font></strong></code></p>

<p><i>Note: Internet Explorer assumes that if the URL ends with ".xml" or ".xsl", as in
the above example, then the returned file will be XML - even if the media type in the HTTP header
is set to "text/html". You can prevent this behaviour by adding an extra dummy parameter, for example
"&amp;x=y".</i></p>

<p>The source and style parameters identify the source document and stylesheet by URL.
These are interpreted relative to the servlet context. This means that specifying
say "style=/styles/styleone.xsl" in the URL will locate the stylesheet in this file relative to the
root directory for the web server.</p>

<p>The stylesheet is prepared the first time it is used, and held in memory in a cache. The cache may
be cleared (for example, if a stylesheet has been changed) using a URL such as:</p>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
http://server.com/servlets/SaxonServlet?clear-stylesheet-cache=yes
</font></strong></code></p>

<p>This code is provided purely as a sample, in the expectation that you will customise it to your
particular site requirements.</p>

<h2><a name="books">The Book List Stylesheet</h2>

<p>This is a very simple sample stylesheet to illustrate several SAXON extensions.
It uses the XML file <b>books.xml</b> (derived from a file issued originally by Microsoft).
You will find this in the samples\data directory. The DTD is in <b>books.dtd</b></p>

<p> There is a style sheet <b>books.xsl</b> that can be used to display the data: run this as
follows, with the samples directory as the current directory:<p>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet data\books.xml styles\books.xsl ><i>output.html</i><br>
</font></strong></code></p>

<p>This produces an HTML page showing the data. (The output isn't very pretty, if you have
time to write an improved version, please send it in).</p>

<p>The stylesheet takes a parameter named "top-author". This is the name of the "author of the week",
and the default value is "Bonner". To run the stylesheet with a different top author, try:</p>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet data\books.xml styles\books.xsl top-author=Danzig ><i>output.html</i><br>
</font></strong></code></p>

<p>It is possible (under those operating systems I know of) to write the author's name in quotes if
it contains spaces, e.g. top-author="A. A. Milne".

<p>There is another style sheet, books-csv.xsl, which
converts the data into a comma-separated-values file.</p>

<p>There is also a Java program ShowBooks.java (in the samples\java directory) to process the books.xml
 file without using XSL. 
This can be run directly from the command line. It produces on the standard output an
HTML page showing the book list.</p>


<p>To run the application, first make sure the compiled program (ShowBooks.class) is on
the classpath, then execute</p>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
java&nbsp; ShowBooks&nbsp; samples\data\books.xml&nbsp; &gt;test1.html<br>
</font></strong></code></p>

<h2><a name="sql">An SQL style sheet</a></h2>

<p>SAXON implements the <i>element extensibility</i> feature of the XSLT standard, allowing
you to extend the XSLT language by implementing your own stylesheet elements.
A specimen extension has been written to illustrate this feature: it
allows you to create stylesheets to load data into a relational database.</p>

<p>To use the SQL extension elements in a stylesheet, you need to define a namespace prefix
(for example "sql") in the extension-element-prefixes attribute of the xsl:stylesheet element,
and to map this prefix to namespace URI that ends in "/com.icl.saxon.sql.SQLElementFactory".</p>

<p>This extension defines four new stylesheet elements: <b>sql:connect</b>, <b>sql:insert</b>, 
<b>sql:column</b>, and <b>sql:close</b>: <ul>
<li>sql:connect creates a database connection. It has attributes "driver", "database", "user", and "password",
all of which are attribute value templates (so the values can be passed in as parameters).
the driver attribute names the JDBC driver class to be used. The
database name must be name that JDBC can associate with an actual database, and in the sample
stylesheet this database must contain a a table "Book" with three character columns,
"Title", "Author", and "Category".</li>
<li>sql:insert performs an SQL INSERT statement. This causes a row to be added to the table identified
by the "table" attribute.
<li>sql:column is used as a child element of sql:insert, and identifies the name and value of a column
to be included in the INSERT statement. The name of the column is identified by the "name" attribute,
the value may be indicated either by evaluating the expression contained in the "select" attribute, or
as the expanded contents of the sql:column element. The value is always interpreted as a String.
(Remember this is purely a demonstration of extensibility, in a real system there would be a need to
cater for SQL columns of other data types).</li>
<li>sql:close closes the database connection.</ul>

<p>A specimen stylesheet that uses these XSL extension is <b>books-sql.xsl</b>. This loads the contents
of the books.xml file into a database table.<p>

<p>To run this stylesheet you will need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a database (e.g. Microsoft Access) containing a table "Book" with three character columns,
"Title", "Author", and "Category".</li>
<li>Register this database as a JDBC data source. (If you use Microsoft Access, register it as an
ODBC data source called, say, Books, and then it will automatically be available under JDBC as
"jdbc:odbc:Books".</li>
<li>Modify the &lt;sql:connect&gt; element in the stylesheet to specify the correct JDBC connection
name for the database, and if necessary to supply a username and password. Alternatively you can
supply the driver class, database name, username, and password as parameters on the command line.</li>
<li>Execute the stylesheet from the command line, as follows:
</ul>

<p><code><strong><font color="#FF0080">
java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet data\books.xml books-sql.xsl <br>
</font></strong></code></p>

<p>The database will be populated with data from the books.xml document.</p>

<h2><a name="shakespeare">Shakespeare Example</a></h2>

<p>This example works on an input file
containing a Shakespeare play. You can use any of the Shakespeare plays in Jon Bosak's
distribution at <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/bosak/xml/eg/shaks200.zip">
http://metalab.unc.edu/bosak/xml/eg/shaks200.zip</a>,
but for convenience one of them, <em>Othello</em>, is included in the SAXON distribution
(in the samples\data directory).</p>

<h3>Shakespeare stylesheet</h3>

<p>There is an XSL stylesheet, play.xsl, which processes an input play in XML and
generates a set of linked HTML files (one for the play and one for each scene) in an
output directory. To run this, create a directory (say playhtml) and execute the following
from the command line:</p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0080"><code>
cd samples<br>
java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet data\othello.xml styles\play.xsl dir=playhtml</code></font></strong></p>

<p>The last parameter sets the value of the constant <strong>dir</strong> to the value <strong>playhtml</strong>;
this constant is referenced from the style sheet when creating output files.</p>

<!--
<h4>Shakespeare play splitter</h4>

<p>The Java application <strong>Loadplay.java</strong> splits a large XML document into
several smaller linked XML documents.</p>

<p>LoadPlay is a free-standing Java application which you can run from the command line.
It takes as input a full Shakespeare play (for example <b>othello.xml</b> which is
included in the distribution) and splits it into a number of separate XML files, one for
the &quot;front material&quot; of the play, and one for each scene in the play.</p>

<p>To run the program:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure it is on your CLASSPATH </li>
  <li>Ensure you have installed a SAX parser and registered it in the <code>ParserManager.properties</code>
    file </li>
  <li>Change directory to the <code>samples/data</code> directory containing the file <code>othello.xml</code>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the command line:<br>
    <font color="#FF0080"><code>java LoadPlay othello</code></font> </li>
</ul>

<p>A directory called &quot;othello&quot; is created and the play and scene files are
generated within it. The program creates an output directory with the same name (othello)
as the input file (othello.xml). The parameter should therefore be the name of the play
file without its &quot;.xml&quot; suffix.</p>

<h4>Shakespeare servlets</h4>

<p>There are two programs (ShowPlay and ShowScene) for displaying the generated plays and scenes at a web browser.
They are written as Java servlets, and can be run in any web server that supports the
servlet interface.</p>

<p>To run them, follow the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure your web server is properly configured to run servlets</li>
  <li>Copy the two files <strong>ShowPlay.class</strong> and <strong>ShowScene.class</strong>
    into the relevant servlets directory, which depends on which web server you are using. It
    may well be a directory called <strong>servlets</strong>.</li>
  <li>Create an HTML page which references the <strong>ShowPlay</strong> servlet. It should
    contain a hyperlink such as:<br>
    <strong><small><font color="#FF0080">&lt;a
    href=servlets/ShowPlay?dir=plays&amp;play=othello&gt;Othello, the Moor of Venice&lt;/a&gt;</font></small></strong><br>
    Here the <strong>dir</strong> parameter is a directory containing all the Shakespeare
    plays, and the <strong>play</strong> parameter is a subdirectory containing the various
    XML files constituting the text of <em>Othello</em>, which you prevoiusly created using
    the <strong>LoadPlay</strong> program.</li>
  <li>Select this HTML page from your browser and click on the link to <em>Othello</em>. You
    should be able to view the front page of the play, and browse through its individual
    scenes.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have problems getting this to work, and there seem to be no useful diagnostics
visible at the web browser, check in the web server log files. Also, try getting any
sample servlets supplied with the web server to work first: this will ensure that the
environment is OK. The most likely cause of problems is that the code you need (servlets,
SAXON, the XML parser) is not all on the class path used by the web server: this is not
necessarily the same class path as you use from the command line.<code><br>

<h2 align="left"><a name="bible">The Bible</a></h2>

<p align="left">The stylesheet <b>bible.xsl</b> takes as input an XML file containing the text of the Old
or New Testament. These files are not included in the SAXON distribution for space
reasons, but can be downloaded from
 <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/eg/rel200.zip">
 http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/eg/rel200.zip</a>
or from various mirror sites. They were prepared by Jon Bosak.</p>

<p align="left">The output of the stylesheet is a set of 292 HTML files in a single
directory, which together provide a frames-oriented rendition of the text. You can see the
result (for the New Testament) at <a href="http://www.wokchorsoc.freeserve.co.uk/bible-nt/index.html">http://www.wokchorsoc.freeserve.co.uk/bible-nt/index.html</a>.
The application also works with the Old Testament text, but not with the other religious
texts included in Jon Bosak's distribution.</p>

<p align="left">To run the stylesheet first create an output
directory (say htmldir), then execute the following from the command line:</p>

<p align="left"><strong><small><font color="#FF0080">java&nbsp; com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet
&nbsp; data\nt.xml&nbsp; styles\bible.xsl&nbsp; dir=htmldir</font></small></strong></p>

<p align="left">The final parameter sets the value of the XSLT parameter &quot;dir&quot; to
the value &quot;htmldir&quot;, which is referenced within the stylesheet to select a
directory for output files.</p>

<h2><a name="applet">Applet Examples</a></h2>

<p>The directory samples/applet contains two demonstrations showing how to use
Saxon from an applet embedded in an HTML page.</p>

<p>The subdirectory /demo contains a demonstration taken straight from the Xalan
sample application, showing a window with three frames, containing the source document,
stylesheet, and result. Click on "index.html" to open this in the browser, then click on the
"Transform" button to run a transformation. Note that the HTML page is written in such
a way that expects the saxon.jar file to be located in the place where it will be 
unpacked when you unzip the Saxon distribution .zip file; if you move any files, you
will need to change the URL.</p>

<p>The subdirectory /family-tree contains a demonstration showing some members of
the Kennedy family; open the HTML file to view the data. This demonstration is adapted
from the one in my book <i>XSLT Programmer's Reference</i>. It illustrates how repeated
transformations using the same source document and the same stylesheet can be used to
browse around a data-set, without making repeated visits to the server.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="jdom">JDOM Example</a></h2>

<p>Saxon includes an adapter that allows the source tree to be a JDOM document.</p>

<p>To use this facility:</p>

<ul>
<li>The JAR file saxon-jdom.jar must be on the classpath</li>
<li>JDOM beta 9 must be installed and on the classpath</li>
<li>You must be using JDK 1.2 or later.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample application JDOMExample.java illustrates how a JDOM tree can be used
with Saxon. It combines two scenarios: running XPath expressions directly against a
JDOM tree, from the Java application; and invoking a transformation with the JDOM document
supplied as the Source object.</p>

<p>The application is designed to take two arguments, the <code>books.xml</code> file
in the samples/data directory, and the <code>total.xsl</code> file in the samples/styles
directory. The application builds a JDOM tree, modifies it <i>in situ</i> to add extra
attributes, and then references these attributes from the stylesheet.</p>
