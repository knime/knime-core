<h2>How to test and use your Node</h2>
<p>In order to test our new node implementation we need to start a
new &quot;runtime workbench&quot; (which is basically an eclipse
instance started from our running eclipse). To do so, go to
&quot;Run&quot; menu and select &quot;Run ...&quot;. In the dialog,
select &quot;Eclipse Application&quot; on the left and click the
&quot;New launch configuration&quot; button as shown in the following
screenshot:<br />

<p>You may want to give the new configuration a meaningful name
and/or change the runtime parameters of the configuration such as
enabling assertions or giving the newly spawned Java process more memory
(e.g. in the arguments tab under &quot;VM arguments&quot; you have to
enter &quot;-ea -Xmx512M&quot; in order to use assertions(-ea) and
increase the available heap space to 512MB.</p>
<p>Launch the configuration using the "Run button". In the opened
runtime workbench open the KNIME perspective (i.e. &quot;Window&quot; -
&quot;Open Perspective&quot; - &quot;Konstanz Information Miner&quot;).
You will notice that it also contains your newly defined node in the
node repository. Please note that you do all these steps only once, the
run configuration is saved and available in the run history, i.e. you
restart the workbench by clicking the run button.</p>

<h2>Export and deploy your Node as a plugin</h2>
<p>Once you have tested your new plugin, using the runtime
workbench, it is time to deploy your Node as a plugin. This is done by
using the &quot;Export deployable plug-ins and fragments&quot; wizard.
Just right-click your plugin and choose &quot;Export...&quot;. In the
window that appears select the &quot;Plug-in Development&quot; folder
and within this, the &quot;Deployable plug-ins and fragments&quot;
wizard. After pressing the &quot;Next&quot; button the wizard displays a
list with all available plugins in your workspace and the one you
right-clicked is selected. Thus, you just have to select a directory to
deploy your plugin to or an archive file. In case you select a directory
the plugin is exported to this destination within a directory called
&quot;plugin&quot;. This directory then contains the plugin as a .jar
file. In case you select an archive file, the &quot;plugin&quot; folder
containing the .jar file is zipped to the specified archive.</p>
<p>Once, the plugin is exported it can be installed in any KNIME
installation or any Eclipse installation that contains the basic KNIME
plugins by copying the content of the &quot;plugin&quot; folder to the
plugin folder of the KNIME / Eclipse installation. Note that you have to
restart your installation in case it is currently running.</p>
