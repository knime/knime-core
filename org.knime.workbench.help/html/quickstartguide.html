<h2>Welcome Screen / Additional features</h2>
<p>When KNIME is started for the first time a welcome screen
appears.</p>

<p><img src="img/quick/KNIME_welcome_small.png" /></p>

<p>From here you can
<ol>

	<li>Open KNIME workbench: opens the KNIME workbench to immediately
	start exploring KNIME, build own workflows and explore your data.</li>
	<li>Get additional nodes: in addition to the ready-to-start basic
	KNIME installation there are additional plug-ins for KNIME e.g. an R
	and Weka integration, or the integration of the Chemistry Development
	Kit with additional nodes for the processing of chemical structures,
	compounds, etc. You can download these features later from within KNIME
	(File, Update KNIME...) as well</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Workbench overview</h2>
<p>The KNIME Workbench is organized as follows:</p>

<p><img src="img/quick/workbench_small.png" /></p>

<h2>Building a workflow</h2>
<p>A workflow is built by dragging nodes from the Node Repository to
the Workflow Editor and connecting them. Nodes are the basic processing
units of a workflow. Each node has a number of input- and/or output
ports. Data (or a model) is transfered via a connection from an out-port
to the in-port of another node.</p>

<h3>Node Status</h3>
<p>When a node is dragged to the workflow editor the status light
lights up red, which means that the node has to be configured in order
to be able to be executed. A node is configured by right-clicking it,
choosing "Configure", and adjusting the necessary settings in the node's
dialog.</p>

<p><img src="img/quick/configure_execute.png" /></p>

<p>When the dialog is closed by clicking the "OK" button, the node
is configured and the status light changes to yellow: the node is ready
to be executed. Right-click the node again shows an enabled "Execute"
option; clicking it will execute the node and the result of this node
will be available at the out-port. After a successful execution the
stauts light of the node is green. The result(s) can be inspected by
exploring the out-port view(s): the last entries in the context menu
open them.</p>

<h3>Ports</h3>
<p>Ports on the left are input ports, where the data from the
out-port of the predecessor node is provided. Ports on the right are
out-ports. The result of the node's operation on the data is provided at
the out-port to successor nodes. A tooltip provides information about
the output of the node, further information can be found in the node
description. Nodes are typed such that only ports of the same type can
be connected.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Data Port</dt>
	<dd>The most common type is the data port (a white triangle) which
	transfers flat data tables from node to node.</dd>
	<dd><img src="img/quick/data_ports.png" /></dd>

	<dt>Database Port</dt>
	<dd>Nodes executing commands inside a database are recognized by
	their database ports (brown square):</dd>
	<dd><img src="img/quick/database_port.png" /></dd>

	<dt>PMML Ports</dt>
	<dd>Data Mining nodes learn a model which is passed to the
	referring predictor node via a blue squared PMML port.</dd>
	<dd><img src="img/quick/pmml_ports.png" /></dd>

	<dt>Other Ports</dt>
	<dd>Whenever a node provides data that does not fit a flat data
	table structure, a general purpose port for structured data is used
	(dark cyan square). All ports not listed above are known as "unknown"
	types (gray square).</dd>

<h2>Uninstalling</h2>
<p>KNIME is uninstalled from your system by simply deleting the
installation directory. By default the workspace is also in this
directory. If you have chosen a different location for the workspace be
sure to delete this directory as well.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>We now want to take you step-by-step through the process of
building a small, simple workflow: we read in data from an ASCII file,
assign color to it, cluster the data and display the data in a table and
a scatter plot. After we execute this flow we will examine the data
model that has been built. We assume you have just started KNIME with an
empty workflow.</p>

<h3>Adding Nodes</h3>
<p>In the Node Repository expand the &quot;IO&quot; and the contained &quot;Read&quot;
category as depicted below (left picture) and drag&amp;drop the <i>File
Reader</i> icon to the <i>Workflow Editor</i> window.</p>

<p><img src="img/quick/node_repositories.png" /></p>
<p>The next node for now will be the k-Means clustering algorithm.
Expand the &quot;Mining&quot; category followed by the &quot;Clustering&quot; category, and
then drag the <i>K-Means</i> node to the flow (picture on the right).</p>
<p>In the search box of the <i>Node Repository</i> enter &quot;color&quot; and
press Enter. This limits the nodes shown to the ones with &quot;color&quot; in
their name (see figure above in the middle). Drag the <i>Color
Manger</i> node to the workflow (this node will define the color in the data
views later). To see all nodes in the repository again, press the ESC or
Backspace key in the search field of the <i>Node Repository</i>. Now,
drag the <i>Interactive Table</i> and the <i>Scatter Plot</i> from the
"Data Views" category to the <i>Workflow Editor</i> and position it to
the right of the <i>Color Manager</i> node.</p>

<h3>Connecting Nodes</h3>
<p>Now you need to connect the nodes in order to get the data
flowing. Click an output port and drag the connection to an appropriate
input port. Complete the flow as pictured below:</p>
<p><img src="img/quick/kmeans_flow.png" /></p>
<p>Your nodes will not show a green status, as long as they are not
configured and executed.</p>

<h3>Configuring Nodes</h3>
<p>Fully connected nodes with a red status icon need to be
configured. Start with the <i>File Reader</i>, right-click it and select
&quot;Configure&quot; from the menu. Navigate to the &quot;IrisDataSet&quot; directory
located in the KNIME installation directory. Select the data.all file
from this location. The <i>File Reader</i>'s preview table shows a
sample of the data.</p>
<p><img src="img/quick/FileReaderDialog_2.png" /></p>
<p>Click OK to close the dialog of the <i>File Reader</i> node. Once
the node has been configured correctly, it switches to yellow (meaning
ready for execution). After that, the <i>K-Means</i> node immediately
turns yellow, as its default settings are applied. To be sure, that the
default settings fit your needs, open the dialog and inspect the default
settings.<br />

In order to configure the <i>Color Manager</i> node you must first
execute the <i>K-Means</i> node. After execution all nominal values and
the ranges of all attributes are known: this meta information is
propagated to the successor nodes. The <i>Color Manager</i> needs this
data before it can be configured. Once the <i>K-Means</i> node is
executed, open the configuration dialog of the <i>Color Manger</i> node.</p>

<p><img src="img/quick/ColorManagerDialog_2.png" /></p>

<h3>Executing Nodes</h3>
<p>Now execute the <i>Scatter Plot</i> node: the workbench executes
all predecessor nodes for you. In a larger, more complex flow you could
select multiple nodes and trigger execution for all of them. The
workflow manager executes the nodes as needed, if possible in parallel.
</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Results</h3>
<p>In order to examine the data and the results, open the nodes'
views. In our example, the <i>K-Means</i>, the <i>Interactive Table</i>
and the <i>Scatter Plot</i> have views. Open them from the nodes'
context menus.</p>

<h4>Hiliting</h4>
<p>Select some points in the scatter plot and choose &quot;Hilite
Selected&quot; from the &quot;Hilite&quot; menu. The hilited points are marked with an
orange border. You will also see the hilited points in the table view.
The propagation of the hilite status works for all views in all branches
of the flow displaying the same data.</p>

<h3>Embark on Your Own Voyage of Discovery!</h3>
<p>This was just a very simple example to get you started. There is
a lot more to discover. Play with it! We tried to keep it simple and
intuitive. It would be great to receive your feedback and find out what
you liked and what you did not like; things you find awkward or things
that did not seem to work.</p>
