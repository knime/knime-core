<body>
This package contains classes responsible for the representation and conversion
of bit vectors. The {@link org.knime.base.data.bitvector.BitVectorCell}
represents a bitvetor in a DataTable.
The {@link org.knime.base.data.bitvector.BitString2BitVectorCellFactory}
converts strings of 0s and 1s into bitvector cells, the 
{@link org.knime.base.data.bitvector.Hex2BitVectorCellFactory} converts a 
hexadecimal representation into bitvectors cells and the
{@link org.knime.base.data.bitvector.IdString2BitVectorCellFactory} converts
Strings where the positions of the bit to set are listed into bitvector cells.
