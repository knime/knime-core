<body>
<p>This package contains the utility classes for normalization of DataRows.
The Normalizer is the main class to perform different types of normalization.
Except for the decimal scaling, an AffineTransTable is produced, whose 
AffineTransRowIterator does the scaling when a DataRow is requested.
