<em>All classes of this package are not part of the offical API and might 
undergo changes until the next release. It is not recommended to rely on the 
stability of this API.</em> 
Contains classes to represent different kinds of coordinate axis. <br>
A coordinate is considered to be a mapping of the real domain range to a given 
absolute range determined by outer constraints (like the screen size).
There exists an abstract class for a coordinate which handles the calculations
and an abstract coordinate mapping class holding the actual mapping.
For different data types exist special implementations dealing wiht the 
different needs ot these types.
