	<shortDescription>
		Writes data into a file in ARFF format.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
    This node saves data to a file or to a remote location denoted by an URL in ARFF format. In the configuration
    dialog,
    specify a valid destination location. When executed, the node writes the data, coming through its input port, into the
    specified location.
    At this point in time, it only writes not-sparse ARFF files (i.e. it
    always writes out all data, even if its value is zero).
    <br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.  
		</intro>
        <option name="File Chooser">
            Enter a valid file name or URL. You can also choose a previously selected location from the drop-down list, or select a local 
            file from the "Browse..." dialog. 
        </option>
        <option name="Overwrite OK">
            If unchecked, the node refuses to execute when the output 
            file exists (prevent unintentional overwrite).
