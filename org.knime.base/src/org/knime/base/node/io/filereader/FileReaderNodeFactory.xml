	<name>File Reader</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Flexible reader for ASCII files.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
		This node can be used to read data from an ASCII file or URL location.
		It can be configured to read various formats.<br />
		When you open the node's configuration dialog and provide a filename, 
		it tries to guess
		the reader's settings by analyzing the content of the file.
		Check the results of these settings in the preview table. If the 
		data shown is not correct or an error is reported, you can adjust the
		settings manually (see below).<br />
		<p />
		The file analysis runs in the background and can be cut short by clicking
		the &quot;Quick scan&quot;, which shows if the analysis takes longer.
		In this case the file is not analyzed completely, but only the first 
		fifty lines are taken into account. It could happen then, that
		the preview appears looking fine, but the execution of the File Reader
		fails, when it reads the lines it didn't analyze. Thus it is recommended
		you check the settings, when you cut an analysis short. <br />
		</intro>
		
		<option name="ASCII file location">Enter a valid file name or URL. When
			you press ENTER, the file is analyzed and the settings pre-set.
			You can also choose a previously read file from the drop-down list,
			or select a file from the "Browse..." dialog.
			</option>		
		<option name="Preserve user settings"> If checked, the checkmarks and
		    column names/types you explictly entered are preserved even if 
		    you select a new file. By default, the analyzer starts with fresh
		    default settings for each new file location.
		    </option>
		<option name="Read row IDs">If checked, the first column in the file
			is used as row IDs. If not checked, default row headers are
			created.</option>
		<option name="Read column headers">If checked, the items in the first 
			line of the file are used as column names. 
			Otherwise default column names are created.</option>
	    <option name="Column delimiter">Enter the character(s) that separate
	    	the data tokens in the file, or select a delimiter from the list.
			</option>
	    <option name="Ignore spaces and tabs">If checked, spaces and the TAB
		    characters are ignored (not in quoted strings though).
		    </option>
	    <option name="Java style comment">Everything between '/*' and '*/' is
	    	ignored. Also everything after '//' until the end of the line.
			</option>
	    <option name="Single line comment">Enter one or more characters that
	    	will indicate the start of a comment (ended by a new line).
			</option>
	    <option name="Advanced...">Opens a new dialog with advanced settings.
	    	There is support for quotes, different decimal separators in 
	    	floating point numbers, and character encoding. Also, for 
	    	ignoring whitespaces, for allowing rows with too few data items, 
	    	for making row IDs unique (not recommended for huge files), 
	    	for a global missing value pattern,
	    	and for limiting the number	of rows read in.	    
			</option>
	    <option name="Click on the table header">If the column header in the 
	    	preview table is clicked, a new dialog 
	    	opens where column properties can be set: name 
	    	and type can be changed (and will be fixed then).
	     	A pattern can be entered that will cause a "missing
	        cell" to be created when it's read for this column. Additionally,
	        possible values of the column domain can be updated by selecting
	        "Domain". And, you can choose to skip this column entirely, i.e. it
	        will not be included in the output table then.
