<body>
Contains nodes that generate/create or write out <code>DataTables</code>.
These nodes usually are instantiated at the beginning or the end of a data flow.
There are reader nodes (like filereader, ARFFreader, etc.) that create data 
tables from files or any other source. The writer nodes (like CSVwriter, 
ARFFwriter, etc.) write out data tables that come in through their input ports.
In addition there is the FileTokenizer which can be used to cut
an ASCII stream into tokens.
