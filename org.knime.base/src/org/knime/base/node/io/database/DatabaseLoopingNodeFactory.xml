		<intro>
		  This node runs SQL queries in the connected database restricted by the 
          possible values given by the input table. It establishes and opens a 
          database access connection from which to read data and restricts 
          each SQL query so that only rows that match the possible values from
          the input table are retrieved.  
	      <br/>
	      The place holder in brackets for table name and table column must be
	      replaced, while the possible value place holder enclosed in hashes must not 
	      be edit and will be resolved during execution.
	      <br/>
          <br />
          If the optional input is connected the database connection information is taken from the port, otherwise
          you need to specify the connection information in the dialog. 
          <br/>
          <br />
	      Make sure you have your vendor-specific database driver registered in
	      the KNIME preference page (section Database Driver). By default, the 
	      sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver (Windows and Linux) is only available.
	   </intro>
		
	<option name="Database Driver">
		Enter the database driver here; it is a Java class (including the
		package path), for example: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
		Additional driver can be registered via KNIME's preference page
        (Database Driver).
	</option>
	<option name="Database Name">
        Enter the database name here, for example 
        jdbc:odbc:database_name or jdbc:mysql://host:port/database_name
	</option>
	<option name="Workflow Credentials">
	    If checked, the credentials (user and password) are used as defined on 
	    the workflow. The credential name links to the specified user and 
	    password. Those can be replaced or edit using the 'Workflow Credentials'
	    menu available in the workflow context menu.
	</option>
	<option name="User Name">
        Your log-in user name for the database.
	</option>
	<option name="Password">
        Your log-in password for the database. Note, the password is
        de- and encrypted before handling it internally.
	</option>
    <option name="TimeZone">
	    Select the TimeZone to convert the date, time or timestamp field into. The current implementation can't 
	    represent time zones. In order to support persisting those fields into a database, the time values can be 
	    changed according to the selected time zone, which is used as the offset (including the daylight saving time)
        for the original values: <i>No Correction (use UTC)</i> is used for workflows (created before 2.8) and doesn't
        apply any correction, <i>Use local TimeZone</i> uses the local time zone offset to correct the date field 
        before reading or writing, and <i>TimeZone: </i> allows selecting the time zone to covert the date values into.
	</option>
	<option name="SQL Statement">
        Enter the SQL-like query here, for example SELECT * FROM table. The 
        WHERE statement is automatically adjusted according to the possible
        values of the selected column.
	</option>
    <option name="Column selection">
        Select one column whose possible (distinct) values are used to 
        constrain the SQL WHERE clause.
	</option>
	<option name="Aggregate by row: ">
        If this option is selected, the final output table will only contain one
        row per value of the aggregated column. All other column values
        are aggregated and separated by comma.
	</option>
	<option name="Append grid column: ">
        If this option is selected, the grid column from the input table is
        appended to the end of the resulting output table which is case of a
        more than one value per query, will contain the set of values.
	</option>
	   <option name="No. of Values per Query: ">
        Specifies the number of elements executed in each SQL query.
    </option>
