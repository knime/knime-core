	    Updates the selected rows in the database with the data values from the input tables. 
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	     Updates the data rows in the database with the data values from the input tables.
	     All selected column names need to exactly match the column names from the database. 
	     The WHERE column values need to match the row to update; whereas the SET column values 
	     are replaced by the input row values. 
	     <br/>
	     The output table contains an additional column with the number of rows affected by the UPDATE statement. 
	     A number greater than or equal to zero -- indicates that the command was processed successfully and is 
	     an update count giving the number of rows in the database that were affected by the command's execution
         A value of -2 -- indicates that the command was processed successfully but that the number of rows affected 
         is unknown.	     
	     <br/>
	     Make sure you have your vendor-specific database driver registered in
         the KNIME preference page (section Database Driver). By default, the 
         sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver (Windows and Linux) is only available.
