    <shortDescription>Node at the end of a loop</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Node at the end of a loop. It is used to mark the end of a workflow loop and collects the 
            intermediate results by row-wise concatenation of the incoming tables. The start of the loop is defined by the
            loop start node, in which you can define how often the loop should be executed (either fixed or 
            derived from data, e.g. the "group loop start"). All nodes in between are executed that many times.
        </intro>
        <option name="Row ID policy">
        	It specifies how to deal with the row IDs.
        	<ul>
        	<li>Generate new row IDs - row IDs are newly generated (Row0, Row1, ...)</li>
        	<li>Unique row IDs by appending a suffix - the iteration number is added to each row ID from the incoming table, thus making
            the row IDs unique over all iterations </li>
            <li>Leave row IDs unmodified - the incoming row IDs are not altered. In this case you
            have to make sure that there are not duplicate row IDs in different iterations. Otherwise an error occurs. </li>
        	</ul>
        </option>
        <option name="Add iteration column">Allows you to add a column containing the iteration number to the output table.</option>
        <option name="Ignore empty input tables">
        	If this option is checked empty input tables and there structure are ignored and will not cause the node to fail.
        </option>
        <option name="Allow variable column types">
        	If checked, the loop does not fail when the column types between different table iterations change.
        </option>
		<option name="Allow changing table specifications">
			If checked, the table specifications between iterations can differ. If
			column have been added or removed between iterations, missing values
			are inserted accordingly in the result table.
			If not checked and the table specifications differ, the node will fail.
		</option>
