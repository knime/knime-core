        <intro>
            The LoopStart is the node that starts a loop that increases a variable
            within a user-defined interval by a certain amount. This is very handy for nodes
            inside a loop that take a continuous parameter. The current value is accessible via the
            scope variable
            <tt>loop_value</tt>
            .
            At the end of the loop you need LoopEnd, which collects the results from
            all loop iterations. All nodes in between are executed as many times as you specify in the dialog
            of LoopStart.
