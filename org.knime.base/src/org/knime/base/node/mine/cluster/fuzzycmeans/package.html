<p>The fuzzycmeans package contains all classes for the Fuzzy c-means node.
The node has a dialog and a view. The ClusterMembershipFactory class
produces the appended columns in a DataTable with the memberships
and the winner prototype.
</p>
<p>The <b>FCMAlgorithm</b> class
is the implementation of the Fuzzy c.means algorithm itself. You can perform
a clustering and obtain the cluster centers just by using this class alone.
</p>
<p>The <b>FCMAlgorithmMemory</b> class does the Fuzzy c.means clustering
in the memory instead of iterating over the DataTable.
