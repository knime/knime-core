<body>
This package contains everything necessary for normal subgroup mining.
The algorithms in the package apriori, the data structures in the package 
frequentitemset and the nodes in this package.
There are two nodes: the BitVectorGenerator and the SubgroupMiner.
The BitVectorGenerator generates bitvectors out of either numerical data
or a string with the item id which was present in the transaction.
The SubgoupMiner mines for either frequent itemsets (free, closed or maximal)
or for association rules.
