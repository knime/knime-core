    <shortDescription>Performs a multinomial logistic regression.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Performs a multinomial logistic regression. Select in the dialog a 
            target column (combo box on top), i.e. the response. The two
            lists in the center of the dialog allow you to include only certain 
            columns which represent the (independent) variables.
            Make sure the columns you want to have included being in the right
            "include" list.
            
            See article in wikipedia about 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>
            for an overview about the topic.
            
            This particular implementation uses an iterative optimization procedure
            termed Fisher's scoring in order to compute the model.

        <option name="Target">
            To select the target column. Only columns with nominal data are allowed.
        </option>
        <option name="Values">
            To specify the independent columns the should be included in the regression model. 
            Numeric and nominal data can be included.
