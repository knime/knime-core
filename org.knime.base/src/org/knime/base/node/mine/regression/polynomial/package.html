The <b>polyreg</b> contains two nodes that are used for doing polynomial regression
on numerical data. Instead of only a linear function like in linear regression
the function may contain the examples attribute values in an arbitrary power. This
is especially useful for datasets that contain non-linear dependencies. The linear case
is also covered by this node by setting the maximum degree to 1 in the learner's dialog.
