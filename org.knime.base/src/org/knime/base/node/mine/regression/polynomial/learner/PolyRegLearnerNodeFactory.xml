    <shortDescription>Learner that builds a polynomial regression model from the input data</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node performs polynomial regression on the input data and computes the coefficients that minimize the
            squared error. The user must choose one column as target (dependent variable) and a number of independent variables. By
            default, polynomials with degree 2 are computed, which can be changed in the dialog.
        </intro>
        <option name="Target column">The column that contains the dependent "target" variable.</option>
        <option name="Polynomial degree">The maximum degree the polynomial regression function should have.</option>
        <option name="Column Selection">Select the columns containing the independent variables and
        	move them to the "include" list. </option>
    </fullDescription>

    <ports>
        <inPort name="Training data" index="0">
            The input samples, which of the columns are used as independent variables can be configured in the dialog.
             The input must not contain missing values, you have to fix them by e.g. using the Missing Values node.
        </inPort>
        <outPort name="Data with training error" index="0">
            Training data classified with the learned model and the corresponding errors.
        </outPort>

            The computed regression coefficients as a model for use in the Polynomial Regression Predictor.
