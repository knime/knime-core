	<name>Fuzzy Rule Predictor</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Applies a Fuzzy Rule Model to numeric data and outputs a prediction
	    for each test instance.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	    The first input port contains the test data while the second contains 
	    the Fuzzy Rule Model that is applied to the test data. The output data 
	    has then one additional column containing the predicted class attribute
	    which is the best match for all rules.
		</intro>
		
	    <option name="Choose Name">
			The name of the predicted column appended to the end of the test 
			data.    
		</option>
	    <option name="Don't Know Class">
		    <b>Ignore</b> If selected, no lower degree of class activation 
		    is set, otherwise the specified value between 0 and 1 is used.<br />
		    <b>Default</b> Use the minimum activation threshold from the
		    learning algorithm.<br />
		    <b>Use</b> Instances where the activation lies 
		    above this threshold are classified as a missing (unknown) class. 
		    This is useful in cases where the feature space is not completely 
		    covered by rules.
