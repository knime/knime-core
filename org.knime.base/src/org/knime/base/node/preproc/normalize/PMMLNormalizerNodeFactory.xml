    <shortDescription>Normalizes the attributes of a table and stores its model as PMML fragment.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        This node normalizes the values of all (numeric) columns. In the
			dialog, you can choose the columns you want to work on.
			The following normalization methods are available in the dialog:
		</intro>
		<option name="Min-max normalization">
			Linear transformation of all values such that the minimum and maximum 
			in each column are as given.
		</option>
		<option name="Z-score normalization">
			Linear transformation such that the values in each column are 
			Gaussian-(0,1)-distributed, i.e. mean is 0.0 and standard deviation 
			is 1.0.
		</option>
		<option name="Normalization by decimal scaling">
			The maximum value in a column (both positive and negative) is
			divided j-times by 10 until its absolute value is smaller or 
			equal to 1.
			All values in the column are then divided by 10 to the power of j. 
		</option>
