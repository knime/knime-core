			    hexadecimal, or binary strings or a single collection column.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Generates for each row of a given input table a bit vector. The bit vectors are either generated from 
        multiple numerical or string columns, a string column containing the bit positions to set, hexadecimal 
        or binary strings or a collection column. In order to adjust the node settings please select first the
        source column object e.g. if the bit vector should be created from multiple string/numerical columns or from a
        single string/collection column. Depending on the selected option the corresponding dialog elements are enabled.
        
        <h3>Bit vectors from multiple columns</h3>
        In the case of multiple columns the bit positions in the resulting bit vector correspond to the
        column position in the input table.
        For example if the second and third column of a given input table is selected and the first column is omitted 
        the bit vectors of each row will have length 2. The first bit of the bit vector is set if the value of the 
        second column matches the selected criterion likewise the second bit of the bit vector is set if the value 
        of the third column matches the selected criterion. The columns to consider when creating the bit vector can
        be specified in the multiple column selection section. Using the enforce exclusion/inclusion option the
        node can be configured to handle previously unknown columns. If the enforce exclusion option is selected all
        unknown columns are added automatically to the include list whereas if the enforce inclusion option is selected
        all unknown columns are added to the exclude list. The columns to include can be also defined by a pattern if
        the Wildcard/Regex Selection option is selected.
        <h4>Multiple string columns</h4>
		The bit of a vector is set if the corresponding column value does match/does not match the specified pattern
        depending on the "Set bit if pattern does match/does not match" option. The pattern may contain wildcards such 
        as '?' or '*' to match any one character or any sequence (including none) of characters. 
        It can also be a complex 
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
        <h4>Multiple numeric columns</h4>
		There are two options to determine if the bit is set for the value in 
        the corresponding column or not: 
        <ul>
        <li>either a global threshold is defined, then all values which are above or equal to
        the threshold are converted into set bits, all other bit positions remain 0, or</li>
        <li>a certain percentage of the mean of each column is used as a threshold,
        then all values which are above or equal to the percentage of the mean 
        are converted into set bits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bit vectors from a single column</h3>
        In the case of a single input column only the selected single column to be parsed is considered for the 
        generation of the bit vectors. 
		<h4>Single string column</h4>
		In the case of a string input only the column containing the string is 
		considered for the generation of the bit vectors. The string is parsed 
		and converted into a bit vector. There are three valid input formats 
		which can be parsed and converted:
		<ul>
		<li>Hexadecimal strings: strings consisting only of the characters 0-9 and A - F 
		(where lower- or uppercase is not important). The represented hexadecimal number is 
		converted into a binary number which is represented by the resulting bit vector.</li>
		<li>Binary strings: strings consisting only of 0s and 1s are parsed and 
		converted into the according bit vectors.</li>
		<li>ID strings: strings consisting of numbers (separated by spaces) 
		where the numbers refer to those positions in the bit vector which should be set.
		(Typical input format for association rule mining).</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Single collection column</h4>
        In the case of a single collection column each unique collection element gets a bit position assigned.
        The length of the bit vectors corresponds to the number of unique elements in a collection cells.
        For example if the input table contains two rows with the collections {a,b} and {b,c} the corresponding
        bit vectors will be [110] and [011].
        
		<h4>Missing values</h4>
		For numeric data the incoming missing values will result in 0s.
        For multiple string columns a missing values will also result in 0s.
		For the string input missing values will also result in a missing value 
		in the output table. If a string could not be parsed it will also result in
		a missing cell in the output table and an error message with detailed information is printed in the console.
        For a collection column all missing collection elements are ignored.

            Select this option to use wild cards in the pattern. Wildcard patterns contain '*' (matching any sequence of

            Select this option to specify a regular expression. Examples of regular expressions are given below.
            "<tt>^foo.*</tt>" matches anything that starts with "foo". The '^'-character
            stands for the beginning of the word, the dot matches any (one) character,
            and the asterisk allows any number (including zero) of the previous character.<br />
            "<tt>[0-9]*</tt>" matches any string of digits (including the empty string).
            The <tt>[</tt> <tt>]</tt> define a set of characters (they could be
            added individually like <tt>[0123456789]</tt>, or by range). This set
            matches any (one) character included in the set.<br />

            requiring the same amount of bits for all vectors e.g. the vector length in bits.  
            The sparse vector type stores only the indices of the set bits thus depends the space required to store a
            bit vector depends on the number of set bits. Each set bit requires between 32 and 64 bits depending on the
            operating system. Therefore the sparse option should be only selected if the majority of the bit vectors
            contain only few set bits e.g. less than 10%.
