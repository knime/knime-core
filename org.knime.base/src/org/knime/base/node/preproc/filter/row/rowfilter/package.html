<body>
Contains all filters currently implemented for the row filter node. <p>

There is one base class <code>RowFilter</code> (see RowFilter.java) all filters
must be derived from. It forces you to implement three functions for each new
row filter: <br>
<code>matches</code>, which returns a boolean result indicating whether or not 
to include the row into the result,<br>
<code>saveSettings</code>, a method saving the filter's settings into a config 
object, and<br>
<code>loadSettingsFrom</code> which should read the settings from a config
object. <p>

In order to recreate a filter from a given config object there exists a
rowfilter factory (see <code>RowFilterFactory</code>). The abstract RowFilter
adds an identifier string to the config object (before it delegates the
actual saving of the settings to the derived class) and the factory reads
this ID string (at loading time) to create the corresponding filter class. 
As a consequence of this, each new filter must be registered with the
<code>RowFilterFactory</code>. The wheres and hows can be easily figured
out by looking at the comments in RowFilterFactory.java and to look at the
existing examples there.

Filters must decide in the <code>matches</code> method if a row should be
included (result <code>true</code>) or filtered out (result <code>false</code>)
from the result table. For that the entire row and the row number is passed to
this function. However, if a filter can already tell the result for the current 
row and all following rows, it can throw an exception and will not be bothered
for any more rows. There is a <code>EndOfTableException</code> and a 
<code>IncludeFromNowOn</code> exception which can be thrown to exclude/include 
resp. the current and all following rows.
