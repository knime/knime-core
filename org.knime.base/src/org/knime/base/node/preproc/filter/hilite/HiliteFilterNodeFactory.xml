    <shortDescription>Partitions input rows based on their current hilite status.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			This node separates hilited from non-hilited rows in the
			input data according to their hilite status at the time of 
			node's execution. Both tables are then passed to outports. Note, 
			hilite changes that happen after the execution are not reflected 
			in the output tables. You will need to reset and execute the node
			again if you want to get a partitioning based on the changed state.
