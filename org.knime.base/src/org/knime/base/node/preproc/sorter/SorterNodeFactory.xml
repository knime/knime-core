        <intro>
			This node sorts the rows according to user-defined criteria. In the dialog, select 
		    the columns according to which the data should be sorted. Also select
		    whether it should be sorted in ascending or descending order.
		</intro>
		<option name="Add columns">If you want to extend the sorting criteria
		to a higher number of columns as displayed, set the number of columns at
		the bottom and click 'new columns' to add them to the dialog.</option>
		<option name="Move Missing Cells to end of sort list">If selected missing
		values are always placed at the end of the sorted output. This is
		independent of the sort order, i.e. if sorted ascendingly they are 
		considered to be larger than a non-missing and if sorted descendingly
		they are smaller than any non-missing.</option>
