		Aggregates several columns into one single column.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Aggregates several columns into one single column. <br />
		In each row, it
			finds a matching column from the set of selected columns and places
			the name 
			of that matching column into the aggregated result column.
			Which column matches depends on the selected "include method" and 
			the include pattern. <br />
			If no column matches a missing value is added. If multiple columns 
			match execution fails and no output is generated.<br />
			Missing values in the selected columns are ignored. 
			If all selected columns of one row consist
			of missing values a missing value is put in the aggregated column.
			All include methods except the regular expression require columns 
			which are double compatible.

				<li>RegExpPattern: The column matching the provided regular expression 
				pattern matches.</li>
