	<name>Low Variance Filter</name>
	<shortDescription>
		 Filters out numeric columns, which have a low variance.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		  <p>
			Filters out double-compatible columns, whose variance is below
			a user defined threshold. Columns with low variance are likely to 
			distract certain learning algorithms (in particular those which are
			distance based) and are therefore better removed.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Note, the input table should not be normalized.
		  </p>		
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Variance Upper Bound">
			Choose a variance value here. The higher the value, the more columns
			are likely to get filtered out. Choose 0 to filter for columns, which
			only contain one constant value.
		</option>
		<option name="Column Filter">
			Only columns in the &quot;include&quot; list will be considered for
			filtering. Any other column will be left untouched (i.e. will also be present
			in the output table independent of their variance).
