    <intro>
      This node rotates the selected columns from the input table to rows and duplicates
      at the same time the remaining input columns by appending them to each corresponding output row. Example:
     <pre>
Input:
  Value1 Value2 Value3 Extra1 Extra2 Extra3
Output:
  Value1 Extra1 Extra2 Extra3
  Value2 Extra1 Extra2 Extra3
  Value3 Extra1 Extra2 Extra3
      </pre>
    </intro>
          <tab name="Value columns">      
<!--    Select columns to be rotated into one single column.-->
    
        <option name="Exclude">
            This list contains the column names of the input table that are 
            not rotated into the single column.
        </option>

        <option name="Enforce Exclusion">
            Select this option to enforce the current exclusion list to stay
            the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
            of the excluded columns are not available anymore, a warning
            is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
            inclusion list.)
        </option>
        
        <option name="Select">
            Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
            list.

        <option name="Search">
            Use one of these fields to search either within the Include
            or Exclude list for certain column names or name substrings.
            Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next column that 
            matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
            all matching columns to be selected making them movable between
            the two lists.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Include">
            This list contains the column names of the columns that are rotated into one single column.
