	Node that replaces the content of a selected column by dictionary entries. 
	The dictionary is a plain text file whereby lines in the file correspond to 
	dictionary entries. Each row is of the form:
</p>
<pre>  value, key1, key2, ...</pre>
<p>The first element <i>value<i> is the replacement string, the following <i>key</i>
entries are the keys against which the content of the cell is matched. Only 
perfect matches count, non matching cells will be left untouched.
