<body>
A line plot plots the numeric columns of the input table as lines. 
All values are mapped to a single y coordinate. 
This may distort the visualization if the difference of the values in the 
columns is large. 
<p>
The {link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.line.LinePlotter} extends the 
{link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.scatter.ScatterPlotter}, since it 
calculates the dots where each datapoint of one column resides on the 
drawing pane. 
Hence, the minimum and maximum of all columns is used as the range in which 
each entry of one column lies. The so calculated dots are passed to the 
{link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.line.LinePlotterDrawingPane}. The color 
for each line is put into a color mapping which is also passed to the 
{link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.line.LinePlotterDrawingPane}. 
The color mapping is created by dividing the hue circle of the HSB color model
by the number of selected columns and retrieve the color of each resulting 
segment.
