  <title>Histogram data model package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This package contains all data and visualization models which are used in
the different histogram implementations.</p>
<p>A histogram consists of one or more {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.histogram.datamodel.BinDataModel}
which are drawn next to each other
at their corresponding x value on the x axis. The value of a row for the 
selected x column defines to which bin a row belongs.</p>
<p>Each bin contains one or more {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.histogram.datamodel.BarDataModel}. 
A bar represents a selected aggregation 
column. The height of the bar is the aggregated value (count, sum, avg) of all 
values for the selected aggregation column.</p>
<p>A bar contains one or more {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.histogram.datamodel.BarElementDataModel}. 
The BarElements reflect the color of
the row which is defined by the user in the Color Manager node.</p>
