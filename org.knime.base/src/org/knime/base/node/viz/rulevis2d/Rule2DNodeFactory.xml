		<intro>
		Displays crisp or fuzzy rules in two selectable dimensions;
		the data points explained by the rules are also displayed.
		The rules are displayed in the color defined by their referring 
		row identifier (ID) color attribute. They may be selected and hilited. 
		Fuzzy rules are displayed with their core and their support area, 
		with increasing transparency to the edges.
		Note, the node always expects a org.knime.core.data.FuzzyIntervalValue 
		per dimension even when it is a crisp rule. In order to obtain crips rules, simply make the core 
		the same as the support.
