<body>
	Provides functionality for nodes that want to launch external programs.<br />
	The {@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.CommandExecution CommandExecution}
	can be used	to run the external program. It will pick up its output (to 
	standard out and to standard error out), log it to the log file, and keep 
	the last 500 lines in two buffers. It will try to destroy the process if the
	user cancels (through the execution context). And it will return the exit 
	code from the external program.<br />
	The two views provided display a text field and react to 
	{@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.ViewUpdateNotice ViewUpdateNotice}
	events. One is meant to display output to standard error, the other to 
	standard output.<br />
	The provided NodeModel is meant to clue it all together, and here is how:
	Create your own NodeModel by extending  
	{@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.ExtToolOutputNodeModel ExtToolOutputNodeModel}.
	In the execute method use the 
	{@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.CommandExecution CommandExecution}
	to execute the external program. Register your NodeModel as Observer with it,
	to see the output in the views during execution (addObserver). 
	Provide the execution context you get 
	in the parameter list. If the execution succeeds (and returns with an OK exit
	code) save the output through the #setExternalOutput(LinkedList<String>) and
	#setExternalErrorOutput(LinkedList<String>) methods. You get the output from
	the CommandExecution object.
	If the execution throws an Exception, or exists with an error exit code, 
	save the output with the methods #setFailedExternalOutput(LinkedList<String>) and
	#setFailedExternalErrorOutput(LinkedList<String>).
	The NodeModel takes care of saving and loading these buffers when the workflow
	is saved/loaded (don't forget to call the super implementation if you override
	the save/load internals methods).<br />
	To provide views to display the output, in your 
	{@link org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory NodeFactory} create instances of
	{@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.ExtToolStdoutNodeView ExtToolStdoutNodeView}
	(for a view of the output to standard out) and/or
	 {@link org.knime.base.node.util.exttool.ExtToolStderrNodeView ExtToolStderrNodeView}
	(for a view of the output to standard error).
